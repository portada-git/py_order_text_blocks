def copy_block(block: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Creates a deep copy of a block dictionary, ensuring that all data structures
    within the block are duplicated rather than referenced.

    This function iterates over each key-value pair in the `block` dictionary and
    applies `deepcopy` to each value. This ensures that nested objects (like lists,
    arrays, or dictionaries) are fully copied, allowing modifications to the copy
    without affecting the original `block`.

    Parameters:
        block (dict): A dictionary representing a block.

    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary that is an independent, deep copy of the input
                `block`. All nested structures are fully duplicated to avoid
                references to the original data.
